# Handlerbar portfolio
A handlebars version of my current raw HTML/CSS3/JavaScript portfolio.
It was made just for **study purposes** since SEO will be critically strike down by the web crawlers.

* ### Tools used:
  * HandlebarsJS: Develop templating engine.
  * Gulp: Minify and manage multiple templates into one .html file.
